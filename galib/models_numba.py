FASTER SYNTHETIC NETWORK GENERATORS
===================================

This module duplicates some functions in the module 'gamodels.py'
and significantly accelerates their performance. This is achieved thanks to
the Numba package (http://numba.pydata.org) which compiles annotated Python
and NumPy code to LLVM on run-time. Therefore, the use of this module
requires Numba to be installed.

Due to the run-time approach of Numba, the original functions in 'galib.py'
will run faster in very small networks and Numba-based functions take the
lead as network size increases. The precise size limit varies from function
to function and I will report approximate valuesfor each of them. In general,
for any network of N > 100 nodes Numba-based functions run faster.

RANDOM NETWORK GENERATORS
-------------------------

def RandomGraph_Numba(N, L, directed=False, selfloops=False):
    """Generates random graphs with N nodes and L links.

    Similar to an Erdos-Renyi (ER) graph with probability p = rho, where
    rho is the density of links. In ER graphs the total number of links
    varies in different realizations what is unsuitable to compare empirical
    networks with their random counterparts. RandomGraph() allows to create
    random graphs that always have the same number of links. The precise
    formula for rho depends on the options given. For an undirected graph
    with no self-loops allowed, rho = 1/2 * L / (N*(N-1)).

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : integer
        The size of the network (number of nodes).
    L : integer
        Number of links of the resulting random network.
    directed : Boolean
        True if a directed graph is desired. False, for an undirected graph.
    selfloops: Boolean
        True if self-loops are allowed, False otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2, size NxN and dtype = int.
        The adjacency matrix of the generated random graph.

    Notes
    -----
    Make sure to specify the right number of links for the type of graph
    desired. Keep in mind that directed graphs have twice as many links
    (arcs) as graphs (edges).
