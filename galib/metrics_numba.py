FASTER GRAPH ANALYSIS DESCRIPTORS
=================================

This module duplicates the slowest functions of main module 'metrics.py'
and significantly accelerates their performance. This is achieved thanks to
the Numba package (http://numba.pydata.org) which compiles annotated Python
and NumPy code to LLVM on run-time. Therefore, the use of this module
requires Numba to be installed.

Due to the run-time approach of Numba, the original functions in 'metrics.py'
will run faster in very small networks and Numba-based functions take the
lead as network size increases. The precise size limit varies from function
to function and I will report approximate valuesfor each of them. In general,
for any network of N > 100 nodes Numba-based functions run faster.

BASIC CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTORS

MatchingIndex_Numba
    Computes the number of common neighbours of every pair of nodes.

PATHS AND GRAPH DISTANCE FUNCTIONS
----------------------------------

def MatchingIndex_Numba(adjmatrix, normed=True):
    """Computes the number of common neighbours of every pair of nodes.

    The matching index of two nodes i and j is the number of common
    neighbours they are linked with.

    Returns same result as MatchingIndex() in metrics.py but uses an ndarray-based
    algorithm and the Numba package to accelerate the calculations. Recommended
    only for networks of size N > 250 nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2
        The adjacency matrix of the network.

    normed : Boolean, optional
        If 'normed=False', returns the number of common neighbours
        of two nodes i and j. If 'normed=True', the number of common
        neighbours is divided by the total number of different nodes they
        are linked with, so values range from 0 (no common neighbours)
        to 1 (all neighbours are common to i and j). Explicit links i-->j
        and j-->i are excluded because they do not contribute to the
        matching. For example:
            1 --> [2,3,4,5]
            2 --> [4,5,6]
            MI(1,2) = len([4,5])/len([3,4,5,6]) = 0.5

    Returns
    -------
    MImatrix : ndarray of rank-2 of ndtype 'float64'
        A matrix containing the matching index for all pairs of nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function accepts weighted networks but it ignores the weights.
    - If adjmatrix is directed, calling MatchingIndex(adjmatrix) computes the
    matching of the output neighbours. Passing the transpose adjmatrix.T to
    the function computes the matching of the input neighbours.
