readers. It also contains adaptation into Python of measures published by
third-party authors which I needed for my own research.

def TopologicalSimilarity(adjmatrix, coupling):

    This function estimates the expected correlations between its nodes that
    a dynamical process on the network tends to generate. The estimation assumes
    that the "influence" of one node over another distributes over all possible
    paths but that the influence decays along the paths. This decay is estimated
    as the communicability matrix. Pairwise correlation is assumed, according
    to the patterns of inputs two nodes tend to receive.
    See further details in our paper:
    "Bettinardi et al. Chaos 27:047409 (2017)"

    Parameters
    ----------

def CovarianceLinearGaussian(adjmatrix, coupling, noiselevel=1.0, noisearray=[]):
    """Estimates the covariance matrix of a system of Gaussian noise sources.

    This function returns an analytical approximation of the time-average
    covariance matrix of a system of linearly coupled Gaussian noise sources.
    Each node of the system (network) is described as fixed point which receives
    a Gaussian noise and the input from its neighbours. Given that X is the
    vector of states of the nodes and A is the adjacency matrix of the
    connectivity and 'g' a global coupling strength applied to all links, the
    equation of motion of the system is approximately:
        Xdot = -a*X + g* A*X + D*noise
    where 'a' is the decay rate parameter and D is the intensity of the Gaussian
    white noise of variance = 1.
    This model has received many different names. It is often refered as the
    Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the continous version of a discrete-time
    autorregressive model.

    The analytical approximation in this function is coded to match the
    description given in:
        "Tononi et al. PNAS 91, 5033-5037 (1994)"
    which has been often used in the neuroscience / brain connectivity
    literature.

    - NOTE 1: Because this model diverges when g equals the largest eigenvalue
    of the adjacency matrix, it is highly recommended to provide as input the
    normalised version of the adjacency matrix. That is, the adjacency
    matrix divided by its spectral diameter. In that case, 'g' takes values
    between 0 and 1. See "Zamora-Lopez et al. Front. Neuroinform. 4, (2010)".

    - NOTE 2: In case the network is directed, the covariance matrix is
    computed out of the transposed adjacency matrix, such that the dynamics of
    a node is governed by the inputs i receives, instead of by its outputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2
        The adjacency matrix of the network. It can be either weighted or
        binary, directed or undirected. It is recommended to provide the
        adjacency matrix normalised by its largest eigenvalue (or spectral
        diameter).
    coupling : real valued number
        The coupling strength of all connections. 'coupling' should be smaller
        than the spectral diameter of 'adjmatrix'. If this has been already
        normalised, then g can take values between 0 and 1.
    noiselevel : real valued number (optional)
        The intensity of the noise, if all nodes should receive the same.
    noisearray : list, tuple or array_like (optional)
        An array contaning the individual noise level each node receives.
        If left empy, all nodes will receive the same noise level given by
        parameter 'noiselevel'. Else, 'noiselevel' will be replaced by the
        'noisearray' parameter. The length of 'noisearray' must be the number
        of nodes in the network.

    Returns
    -------
    COVmatrix : ndarray of rank-2

    Given the cross-correlation matrix out of some network dynamics or an

    the elements or nodes are (dynamically or statistically) independent of

    variate (dynamical or stochastic) system, e.g. the matrix of pairwise
    mutual information values. The range of accepted values may have to be
