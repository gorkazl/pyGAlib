    The algorithm rewires, clockwise, the links of the first neighbours,
    of the second neighbours, etc. with probability prew. If a link is
    chosen for rewiring, it can't create a self-loop nor a multiple edge.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : integer
        Size of the network (number of nodes).
    z : integer
        Diameter of the neighbourhood that every node connects with.
        For a given z, every node has degree k = 2*z in the resulting lattice.

        The adjacency matrix of a 1D lattice that has to be rewired.
        When several realizations of the model are desired, the initial
        lattice, usually the output of Lattice1D() function, can be passed
        what avoids having to create a new lattice for every realization and
        saving computational time. Recommended

    Returns
    -------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2 and integer type.
        The adjacency matrix of the rewired 1-dimensional lattice.

    Notes
    -----
    1) Unlike the Watts & Strogatz model in which k is the total number of
    neighbours of a node, here z represents the largest z-neighbourhood
    with which a node is connected (left and right). Hence, comparing the
    two parameters, k = 2*z.

    2) When several realizations of the model are desired, the initial
    lattice, usually the output of Lattice1D() function, can be passed
    to the optional argument 'lattice'. This avoids having to create a
    new lattice for every realization and saves computational time.
    Recommended for several realizations of large networks.

    3) The present algorithm is only valid for graphs. In order to obtain
    directed small-world networks, use the RewireNetwork() function on a
    previously created ring-lattice.

    ----------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2
        The adjacency matrix of the network to be rewired. 'adjmatrix' itself
        won't be rewired but a new matrix is returned.
    prewire : float (optional)
        Fraction of links to be rewired. See Usage for further instructions.
    directed : Boolean (optional)
        Specifies the directedness of the returned network. If 'directed' is
        None (default), the function checks the directedness of the input
        network and performs the rewiring accordingly. To save computational
        time the parameter can be manually specified.
        If 'directed' is True, a directed network is returned regardless
        'adjmatrix' is directed or undirected. Input and output degrees are
        conserved.
        If 'directed' is False, an undirected network is returned. Only valid
        when 'adjmatrix' is undirected. DO NOT set 'directed = False' when
        'adjmatrix' is a directed network, degress won't be conserved and the
        function won't raise an error.
    weighted : Boolean (optional)
        Specifies whether the weights of the links are conserved.
        If 'weighted' is False, a binary network is returned.
        If 'weighted' is True, links are switched conserving their weights.
        Notice, however, that it is impossible to conserve simultaneously
        both the degrees and the strength of all nodes. Hence, the weights of
        the links are conserved but only the input strength of the nodes
        are conserved. The output strength of nodes are not conserved.

    Returns
    -------
    rewmatrix : ndarray of rank-2
        The dtype of 'rewmatrix' depends on the option 'weighted'. If
        'weighted' is True, 'rewmatrix' is of same dtype as 'adjmatrix'.
        If 'weighted' is False, 'rewmatrix' has dtype uint8.

    Usage
    -----
    The parameter 'prewire' is not a probability, but a parameter that
    controls the number of iterations the link switching procedure happens.
    At each iteration two links are switched, therefore for a given value of
    'prewire', prewire*L links are rewired in 1/2*prewire*L iterations, where
    L in the number of links. To make sure that all structure of the network
    has been completely randomized (appart from the degrees), values of
    prewire >= 5 are recommended.

def ModularHeterogeneousGraph(Nsizelist, pintlist, pext, directed=False, selfloops=False):
    """
    Generates random modular networks of given module sizes and densities.

    This function generates modular networks in which both the internal
    links within the modules and the external links across modules are shed
    at random. As in the Erdos-Renyi model, every pair of nodes is linked
    with the specified probability and therefore, the total number of links
    slightly varies from one realization to another. The user will specify
    the size and the internal connection probability for each of the modules,
    and one unique probability for the external links across communities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Nsizelist : list, tuple or array of integers
        A list containing the desired size (number of nodes) for every
        module in the network.
    pintlist : list, tuple or array of floats
        A list  containing the internal link probability for each of the
        modules. All values must range between 0 and 1.
    pext : float
        The external probability of connection between nodes in different
        communities.
    directed : Boolean (optional)
        True if a directed graph is desired, False if an undirected graph is
        desired.
    selfloops: Boolean (optional)
        True if self-loops are allowed, False otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2 and dtype = uin8
        The adjacency matrix of the generated random modular graph.
    partition : list of ndarrays of dtype = uint
        A list containing the indices of the nodes in each module.

    Usage and examples
    ------------------
    Setting Nsizelist = [100,200,300], pintlist = [0.3, 0.3, 0.5] and
    pext = 0.01 will generate a random graph of size N = 600 nodes with
    three modules of sizes N1 = 100, N2 = 200 and N3 = 300 nodes respectively.
    Each module is an Erdos-Renyi random graph with link probability
    (approximate density of links) pint1 = 0.3, pint2 = 0.3 and pint3 = 0.5
    respectively. The probability that a pair of nodes in different
    modules are connected is pext = 0.01.

    This function generalizes the benchmark hierarchical and modular network
    models introduced in [M.E.J. Newman & M. Girvan, Phys. Rev. E 69, 026113
    (2004)] and in [A. Arenas, A. Diaz-Guilera & C.J. Perez-Vicente, Phys.
    Rev. Lett. 96, 114102 (2006)]. It creates networks of networks that are
    randomly connected at each hierarchical level, i.e., random networks
    that are randomly connected with each other forming larger modules that
    randomly connect with each other. The communities of each level are
    of same size and link density.

    Parameters
    ----------
    HMshape : list, tuple or array-like.
        HMshape must be a list of integer numbers indicating the target
        hierarchical and modular structure. For example, HMshape = [2,4,20]
        will create a network of 2 modules, each module is divided into 4
        modules of 20 nodes each.
    avklist : list, tuple or array-like.
        The mean degree of the nodes at each hierarchical level. For example,
        avklist = [1,3,20] will generate a network in which nodes will have,
        on average, 20 links with their neighbours at the lowest level
        submodule they belong to, 3 links with the rest of neighbours at the
        submodule they belong to at the second level, and 1 link with any
        node at any community of the rest of the network.
    directed : boolean (optional).
        If true, the resulting network will be directed, else, it will be
        undirected.
    outdtype : data type (optional)
        Data-type of the resulting adjacency matrix. Default: uint8.

    Returns
    -------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2.
        The adjacency matrix of the generated modular and hierarchical
        network.

    Usage and examples
    ------------------
    The function accepts any desired number of hierarchical levels and
    partitions of the levels into desired number of nodes or communities.
    - HMshape = [4,4,16] will create a network of 4x4x16 = 256 nodes and
    three hierarchical levels. The network contains 4 communities, each
    subdivided into 4 communities of 16 nodes.
    - HMshape = [2,5,3,20] will generate a network of 2x5x3x20 = 600 nodes
    and four hierarchical levels. The network is composed of 2 communities,
    each subdivided into 5 communities, each subdivided into 3 communities
    of 20 nodes each.

    The parameter 'avklist' controls the density of connections between
    the modules in each of the hierarchical levels.
    - avklist = [1,3,13], for the first example above, means that each node
    is connected with 13 nodes of the first level, to 3 nodes in other
    communities at the second level and makes one link with nodes in the
    rest of the network which do not belong to the same modules in either
    the first or the second level.

    In order to generate the 13-4 or the 15-2 networks in [Arenas et al,
    Phys. Rev. Lett., 114102 (2006)], the function has to be called with
    parameters HMshape = [4,4,16] and avklist = [1,4,13] or avklist = [1,2,15]
    respectively.

    Notes
    -----
    The degrees given with parameter 'avklist' are average degrees. Due to
    the random generation process, every node will only have the desired
    internal and external degrees on the ensemble average, but not
    necessarily in each realization.

    """    Generates random hierarchical and modular networks of desired number
    of hierarchical levels and modules, with centralised inter-modular
    connectivity through local hubs.

    This function creates networks of networks that are randomly connected
    at each hierarchical level. The submodules at the lowest level are
    random scale-free-like graphs. Setting a high exponent for this
    level (e.g. gamma=[x,x,100]) will make them usual random graphs.
    At each heirarchical level, the links between modules are seeded
    following a preferential attachment rule (same as as for the generation
    of scale-free graphs). The nodes at every module are assigned different
    probability to link with other modules, hence, the inter-modular links
    end up concentrated on few hubs, with every community having its own
    set of hubs.

    anatomical constraints in the brain: the significance of network
    modularity and rich-clubs." Scientific Reports 6:38424 (2016).

    Parameters
    ----------
    HMshape : list, tuple or array-like.
        HMshape must be a list of integer numbers indicating the target
        hierarchical and modular structure. For example, HMshape = [4,50]
        will create a network composed of 4 modules of 50 nodes each.
        HMshape = [2,4,50] will create a network of 2 modules, each module
        divided into 4 submodules of 50 nodes each.
    avklist : list, tuple or array-like.
        The mean degree of the nodes at each hierarchical level. For example,
        avklist = [1,3,20] will generate a network in which nodes will have,
        on average, 20 links with their neighbours at the lowest level
        submodule they belong to, 3 links with the rest of neighbours at the
        submodule they belong to at the second level, and 1 link with any
        node at any community of the rest of the network.
    gammalist : list, tuple or array-like.
        Exponent controling the preferential attachement rule at each
        level. For a network with HMshape = [4,50], setting gammalist =
        [2.0,3.0] will create a network of four modules of 50 nodes each.
        Internally, the four submodules are scale-free-like networks with
        exponent gamma = 3.0. The links between modules are seeded at random
        but
    directed : boolean (optional).
        If true, the resulting network will be directed, else, it will be
        undirected.
    outdtype : data type (optional)
        Data-type of the resulting adjacency matrix. Default: uint8.

    Returns
    -------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2.
        The adjacency matrix of the generated modular and hierarchical
        network.

    Usage and examples
    ------------------
    The function accepts any desired number of hierarchical levels and
    partitions of the levels into desired number of nodes or communities.
    - HMshape = [4,4,16] will create a network of 4x4x16 = 256 nodes and
    three hierarchical levels. The network contains 4 communities, each
    subdivided into 4 communities of 16 nodes.
    - HMshape = [2,5,3,20] will generate a network of 2x5x3x20 = 600 nodes
    and four hierarchical levels. The network is composed of 2 communities,
    each subdivided into 5 communities, each subdivided into 3 communities
    of 20 nodes each.

    The parameter 'avklist' controls the density of connections between
    the modules in each of the hierarchical levels.
    - avklist = [1,3,13], for the first example above, means that each node
    is connected with 13 nodes of the first level, to 3 nodes in other
    communities at the second level and makes one link with nodes in the
    rest of the network which do not belong to the same modules in either
    the first or the second level.

    The parameter 'gammalist' controls for the probability that every node
    has to be selected while links are seeded. This probability may change
    at different hierarchical levels.
    - gammalist = [2,100] with HMshape = [4,50], will lead to a modular
    network consisting of four random graphs (random because of the high
    gamma=100 at the level of the modules). To seed the inter-modular
    links, two nodes are chosen at random from two different communities.
    Internally, the probability of a node to be chosen differs such that
    each community will have its own hubs such that intermodular links
    preferentially occur between those hubs. The probability of a node within
    a module to be chosen as the target of an intermodular link is
    determined by the exponent gamma = 2, which would eventually to a
    schale-free graph of gamma = 2 in the limit of large networks.

    The Ravasz-Barabasi graph is a pseudo-fractal network that starts from a
    basic motif, a complete graph of size 'Nmotif'. Further hierarchical levels
    are constructed replicating the original motif, by making each of the nodes
    in original motif as the central node of the new replicated motif. All new
    'peripheral' vertices link

    The network is claimed to produce scale-free-like degree distribution but
    modular structure is rather unclear. Two different versions of the model
    where published. In Ref. [science2002], the hubs of each hierarchical level
    are connected forming a ring graph. Note, however, that these links
    between the hubs do not lead to a rich-club. The model in Ref. [pre2003],
    ignored the connections among the local hubs at same hierarchical level hubs.
    This function creates both versions, controled by parameter 'hublinks'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Nmotif : integer
        Size of the basic motif.
    hlevels : integer
        Number of hierarchical levels. Notice that hlevels = 1 will return the
        basic motif, a complete graph of size Nmotif.

    Returns
    -------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2.
        The adjacency matrix of the generated scale-free network. The size of
        the final network is N = Nmotif^hlevels.
