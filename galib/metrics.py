GRAPH ANALYSIS DESCRIPTORS
==========================

This module contains functions to compute many graph descriptors of a
network. Many functions compute also the results both for graphs and
digraphs. Most of functions accept weighted networks as input but they
ignore the weights unless explicitely specified. Support for weighted
measures will be added to GAlib in future releases.

ReciprocalDegree
    Returns the reciprocal degree and excess degrees of every nodes.
AvNeighboursDegree
    Average neighbours' degree of nodes with given degree k, for all k.

            Row-0: the degree k of a node
            Row-1: the degree k' of one of its neighbours

    Notes
    -----
    1) In order to compute the standard deviation the algorithm first pools
    together all neighbours' degree of all nodes with degree k and then
    computes the average and std values.

    2) The function accepts weighted adjacency matrices but it ignores the
    weights of the links. The function works with both directed and with
    undirected networks.

    3) In the case of directed networks there are four classes of degre-degree
    correlations. This can be confusing. Make sure to understand which of
    the four correlation classes you are asking the function to compute.

    4) 'alldata' is provided only for plotting purposes, such that the average
    neighbours' degree can be plotted with all the datapoints in the background.

    Conceptually, a network is said to have a rich-club when it contains hubs
    (largely connected nodes) and those hubs are densely interconnected
    forming a cluster (or community).
    The identification of a rich-club relies on the k-density, a metric that
    iteratively calculates the density of the subnetwork formed by the nodes
    with degree larger than (or equal to) k', for all k' from 0 to kmax.
    See original paper by S. Zhou and R.J. Modragon, IEEE Communication

    NOTE
    Unfortunately, rich-club identification also implies a few arbitrary choices
    and no strict criteria are commonly agreed. This function returns as the
    rich-club the set of nodes remaining in the graph at the point when
    k-density first reaches a given threshold: 'kdensthreshold'. The rich-club
    will be empty if k-density does not reach the value. 'kdensthreshold' is
    an optional parameter. Initially 'kdensthreshold' is set to 0.8, which is a
    very large density, rarely achieved as the internal density by communities
    found in empirical networks by community detection methods. However, we

    information that is also returned by the function.

    """Computes the ratio of link weights among the nodes with strength > s',
    for s' = 0 to s' = smax.

    In the original version for unweighted networks, k-density is defined as
    the density of links of the subnetwork made of nodes with degree k > k'.
    Where the density of a network of N nodes is calculated as the fraction
    between the number of existing links, L, and the maximum number of links
    that the network could posibly host: Lo = 1/2 N(N-1) if the network is
    undirected and Lo = N(N-1) if the network is directed.

    Following the original concept, here the k-density for weighted networks
    calculates the fraction between the weights of the links found among the
    nodes with strength s > s', and the maximum possible weights they could
    accumulate. That is, if the nodes with s' > s where all-to-all connected and
    each link carried the largest weight.

    The calculation of k-density implies an iterative process. At each step,
    the nodes with strength s <= s' are removed from the network and the total
    weight carried by the links of this remaining subnetwork is calculated.

    This function returns the k-density for all values of s, from s = 0
    (the original network) to s = smax, with smax being the strength of the
    most connected node.

    NOTE: Since link weights can take arbitrary real numbers, the strength of
    nodes can be real valued, in contrast to the discrete nature of the
    unweighted degrees. Therefore, instead of iterating over node degrees one
    by one, from k=0 to k=kmax, here the iteration along the range of
    values from s=0 to s=smax is discretised into 'nbins' steps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adjmatrix : ndarray of rank-2
        The adjacency matrix of the network.
    nbins : integer
        The number of bins in which the range s=0 to s=smax will be divided.
    maxweight : scalar, optional
        The largest value that the weight of links can take. Depending on what
        real system the network represents, link values could take different
        ranges. If a maximum value is known, e.g., 1.0 for correlation matrices,
        this information can be passed. The default 'maxweigth=None' implies
        that 'maxweight' is set to the largest value in 'adjmatrix'.
    maxstrength : scalar, optional
        The largest node strength that the function should scan. This parameter
        is useful when comparing a family of networks. Setting the largest
        node strength, given the samne number of bins, the results are obtained
        for the same range of strengths, and therefore, are directly comparable.
        The default is 'maxstrength=None' so, if not given, the largest node
        strength will be calculated from adjmatrix.
    rctype : string, optional
        Defines how to iterate over the node strengths, depending on whether the
        network is directed or undirected.
        - 'undirected' only if the network is undirected. Raises an error if
        selected but 'adjmatrix' represents a non-symmetric network.
        - 'outputs', if the network is asymmetric, the k-density is computed
        considering the nodes with output strength out-s > s'.
        - 'inputs', if the network is directed, the k-density is computed
        considering the nodes with input strength in-s > s'.
        - 'average', if the network is directed, the k-density is computed
        considering that the strength of the nodes is s = 1/2 (in-s + out-s).
        Only use 'average' when the input and output degrees of the network
        are reasonably symmetric.

    Returns
    -------
    strengthlist: ndarray of length 'nbins'
        The values of node strength, from s=0 to s=smax, in 'nbins' steps.
    kdensity : ndarray of length 'nbins'

    Computes the dispersion index of every node. Dispersion is a measure to
    quantify whether a node is well classified within the partition, or it
    is missaclassified. If a node is only connected to nodes in the same
    community, then di = 0. If the node is equally likely connected with two
    of more communities, then pi = 1.

    Given a partition of the network into communities, the participation
    index quantifies how much are the links of a node distributed along
    all the communities of the network. This function computes the definition
    given by Guimera & Amaral, J. Stat. Mech. P02001 (2011).

    Parameters
    ----------
    participmatrix : ndarray
        A matrix of shape N x n, where N is the number of nodes and n is the
        number of communities. Elements, a_is, of the matrix are the number of
        neighbours (degree) that node i has in community s.

    -------
    participindex : ndarray of rank-1 and size N
        Participation index of every node.

    Notes
    -----
    The participation index, as originally defined in Guimera & Amaral,
    J. Stat. Mech. P02001 (2011), is misleading. Use only for comparative
    reasons. The index is defined to be between 0 and 1, taking value 0 when
    a node has only connections in its own community (peripheral node),
    and 1 when its links are equivalently distributed among, so the node is
    unclassifiable in the partition (kinless). However, the true range of this
    participation index depends on the number of communities in the partition.
